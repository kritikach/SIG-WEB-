                                        Park Ji-Min aka Jimin is one of the most active members
                                        of BTS on social media. Born on October 13 in 1995, 
                                        Jimin spent most of his childhood in the Busan district of South Korea.

                                        With a strong affinity towards dancing from an early age,
                                        Jimin started learning popping-and-locking in middle school. 
                                        Post which he joined the Big Hit Entertainment and started training under them.
                                        Meanwhile, Jimin is currently studying media studies with Jungkook, RM, Suga, J-Hope and V.

                                        Apart from being the group's main dancer, 
                                        Jimin is also a vocalist with three solo tracks titled:
                                        Lie, Serendipity and Filter. The BTS ARMY is already in love with Jimin's
                                        infectious smile, but the talented singer continues to
                                        impress them with his creativity as a singer and a performer
